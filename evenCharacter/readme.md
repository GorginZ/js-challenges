You are going to create a function that finds all the 'even' characters in a string and returns them in an array. If the string has less than two characters or more than 100 characters, then you should return `"invalid string"`.

**EXAMPLES**

```javascript
evenCharacters('abcdef');
=> ['b','d','f']

evenCharacters('a;);
=> "invalid string"
```
